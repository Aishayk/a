<center><h1>So i'm going to tell you about my favourite books, why they are my favourite and the lessons.</h1></center>
<br>
<h2>So i'm going to start with amulet. Amulet is one of my favourite books because its kind of like my life. Its really interesting because its a comic and it teaches lessons in a fun way.</h2>
<h2>Now i'm going to tell you about nevermore which I kind of had to read because my dad found it in a car he bought. I would also recommend this for teenagers beacause there some parts that might make you sad, laugh, angry or happy. The lesson for this book is just to accept faith.</h2>
<h2>The third story is about a robot that was took care of a goose because the robot made an avalanche and killed all of the goose's family. Then the egg of the goose hatched.</h2>
<h2>The fourth one is basically the same as third book but just part 2 and that is where the robot has to let go of all her friends.</h2>
<h3>The fifth one is called the one and only bob and its about a dog and its life. Its quite funny so I recommend it for everyone.</h3>
<h3>The last book is called the one and only Ivan and its about a gorilla that escapes from its home.</h3>
